        <p>I would rather be playing Battlefront II on PC and Bowmasters on Mobile.</p>

	    <p>My favorite game of all time is Battlefront II.</p>
	    <p>It is a great game due to its immersion in the battle via graphics and sound design, as well as the wide variety of mods that can be installed on PC.</p>
	    <p>The ratings are 8.8/10 for IGN, 68% for OpenCritic, and 6/10 for Gamespot. I overall agree with these ratings as Battlefront II had an atrocious launch being filled with microtransactions and a relative lack of free content. It took over 2 years to fix these problems but once the game had a content roster most would consider just above the bare minimum, EA decided to cancel support for the game, outraging many players. However, this does not stop the content that made it into the game from being among peak Star Wars gaming.</p>
