        <p>ChatGPT is a generative AI which answers whatever prompt a human puts in, similar to automated customer service systems. It is used for a variety of tasks, ranging from programming code to composing music. This software comes with a wide variety of benefits, such as improved content quality, education, and better response time. However, there are also numerous drawbacks, including plagiarism, lack of knowledge of events after 2021, and its occasional inability to communicate like a human would.</p>
        <p>My stance on the matter is that it is a good technology. There might be some who misuse it, but for the vast majority of its users, ChatGPT is a very good resource. It can help tutor students who don't understand a certain topic, it can make edits to something that a student or worker creates, or it can simply verify if an answer to something is correct.</p>
