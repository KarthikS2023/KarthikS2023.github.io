    <p>The top ranked esports team for Chess as of right now is the Saint Louis Arch Bishops. What makes this team good is the number of Grandmasters on the team, such as Anna Sharevich and Conrad Holt. What this team does well is hold themselves in such high esteem and take pride in both their players and victory.
