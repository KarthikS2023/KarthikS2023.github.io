    <p>Toxicity in gaming comes in a variety of manners. It can come in the form of t-bagging, which is spamming the crouch button in a shooter game after you defeat an enemy, it can come in the form of emoting, which is making your in-game character say a line usually to gloat, or it can be more direct in the form of game chat. It is important to understand this concept as generally it is what dehumanizes gamers and on more than one occasion can affect their behavior in the real world, whether they’re one dealing with toxic behavior or exhibiting it themselves. The best way to combat toxicity in video games would be to simply rise above it and ignore those who don’t. The most common reason for toxicity is that the gamer simply wants to enrage people after they get defeated, and if the defeated player does not exhibit said rage, the defeat is then turned onto the toxic player.</p>
