        <h2>For Chess Beginners</h2>
        <p>If you're new to chess, this website is your gateway to learning and mastering the game. Chess offers countless benefits, such as improving critical thinking, concentration, and problem-solving skills.</p>
        <p>These beginner-friendly resources and guides will help you embark on your chess journey with confidence.</p>
        <p>There are a number of mistakes that chess beginners will make. For example, they will simply see a piece and take it without giving any thought to what the opponent is actually threatening. This tunnel vision routinely leads to the player losing a major piece like a queen, or the opponent just getting an overall better position, usually a potent attack on the king.</p>

        <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
        <h3>How to Play and Improve</h3>
        <p>At the start of the game, the white pieces will move first, and then it will be black's turn, then back to white, and the process repeats for the whole game. To win the game, you need to checkmate your opponent's king, which is basically getting the king into a position where the king is both in check and has no legal moves to play.</p>
        <h3>Pieces</h3>
        <p>Pawn- You will start off with 8 pawns in front of all the other pieces. At the start of the game, the pawn can either move one space forward or two spaces forward. After that, it can only move one space forward, but can move diagonally one space when taking another piece. Once a pawn reaches the other side of the board, the player can decide whether to promote it to a bishop, a rook, a knight, or even a queen.</p>
        <p>Bishop- You will start off with 2 bishops. One will stand adjacent to the king, the other will stand adjacent to the queen. The bishop can move diagonally any number of spaces.</p>
        <p>Knight- You will start off with 2 knights. They will stand between the bishops and rooks. The knights can move in an L shape. More specifically, they move two spaces straight in any direction, then move one space to the right or left. The knight is the most mobile and finessed piece on the board, and it requires extra precaution to avoid their attacks.</p>
        <p>Rook- You will start off with 2 rooks. They will stand on the corners of the board. The rooks can move straight any number of spaces and it is even said that 2 rooks are better than 1 queen.</p>
        <p>Queen- You will start off with 1 queen. The queen can move either diagonally or straight any number of spaces, and it is vital to not lose this piece unless your opponent's queen goes down with it, or if it's part of a larger strategy.</p>
        <p>King- You will start off with 1 king, and this is the piece that drives the whole game. The king can move either straight or diagonally one space, and the game is won when a king is both under attack and has no legal moves to play, which is known as checkmate.</p>
        
        <h3>Strategies for Success</h3>
        <p>Chess is a game of strategy and foresight. It is not as simple as taking your opponent's pieces and defending your own. There are many strategies that involve sacrificing pieces and ignoring attacks. Begin by controlling the center of the board, developing your pieces, and safeguarding your king. Study common openings, middle-game tactics, and endgame techniques to outmaneuver your opponent.</p>
        <p>There are strategies that can be played as early as the beginning of the game that will give you a huge advantage. The following videos will show some of these strategies.</p>
