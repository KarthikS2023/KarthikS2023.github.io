        <p>The article says that Battlefront is an excellent shooter game overall, but that the campaign is rather lackluster. I agree with both of these. In terms of gameplay, Battlefront 2 has entertained me to a grand extent and the mechanics are great to experiment with and find new combos and the like. In the case of the campaign however, it was heavily mismarketed. The campaign was constantly advertised as “Fight for the Empire as Commander Iden Versio” and was supposed to center around her wanting to avenge the Emperor’s death. However, 3 missions in, Iden suddenly realizes out of nowhere that the Empire is wrong and she defects with no build-up whatsoever. Overall, I agree with the article when it says Battlefront 2 is a great game with a bland and mismarketed campaign.
