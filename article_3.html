        <p>There are many factors that define what makes a game good or bad. They can range from graphics to the fundamental gameplay mechanics. An example of a good game I’ve played would be Jedi: Fallen Order. The graphics have massive detail and every object has animation of some sort, but at the same time it’s not to the point where a PC can’t run it, as it runs very smoothly on even a GTX 1650. As for gameplay, Fallen Order has a simple yet advanced combat system. The mechanics are easy to learn but can only be fully mastered with lots of practice. Parrying against melee weapons for example is easy to learn at the beginning, but in order to be able to parry rapid combos of attacks, you must practice against the same enemy multiple times. Fallen Order overall has a great combat system with one of the most rewarding learning curves and the graphics to make fights against enemies all the more cinematic.</p>

        <p>To touch on games that aren’t quite on the level of Fallen Order, there are games such as Sharpshooter Blitz, a mobile game. While the overall idea of the game is good, to clear out rooms of enemies with your gun then advance, it gets boring very quickly for reasons to follow. First off, the graphics are 2d-illustration mixed with 3d-animation, as well as cubical heads, which look weird. Not to mention the eyes which are so big they take up at least 60% of the head. And the gameplay does not help. As of right now the only obstacle in the player’s way is running out of ammo, which even then takes less than 2 seconds to reload. The enemies just stand still, basically waiting for you to kill them, and while they do shoot, the bullets are programmed in such a way that they never hit you, so you can just stand still with about 6 enemies shooting at you, and you won’t take a single hit.</p>
